# slop (The irrational codings of a very confused individual)

Slop is my first ever repository of code developed while practicing Python! 
I thoroughly expect everything to be horrendously coded, and under no circumstances should
anyone consider using this code in any way, shape, and/form. You have been warned.

## Getting Started

I really don't think you should.

### Prerequisites

Please don't even try to install this software. Run far, far away.
But if you do want to try using this code, please install the application: sl
apt install sl

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Authors

* **Tim Patrick** - *Initial work*
