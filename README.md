# slop (The irrational codings of a very confused individual)

Slop is my first ever repository of code developed during my first ever Python course! 
I thoroughly expect everything to be horrendously coded, and under no circumstances should
anyone consider using this code in any way, shape, and/form. You have been warned.

Also, I'd like to learn about how to version control my code using Git!

## Getting Started

I really don't think you should.

### Prerequisites

apt install sl
